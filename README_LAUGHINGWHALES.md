## What's Different?

This fork includes:

- Packages renamed to `@laughingwhales/*` scope
- Custom adapters and features
- Polkadot support enhancements
- Flexible dependency management for rapid development

## Installation

### For Internal Development (Monorepo)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/laughingwhales/sacred-appkit.git
cd sacred-appkit

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run demo app
pnpm demo:dev
```

### For External Projects

You have multiple options to use our fork in your projects:

#### Option 1: GitHub Tarballs (Recommended)

Install directly from GitHub without waiting for npm releases:

```bash
# Install from main branch
npm install https://api.github.com/repos/laughingwhales/sacred-appkit/tarball/main#subdirectory=packages/appkit

# Or add to package.json
```

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@laughingwhales/appkit": "https://api.github.com/repos/laughingwhales/sacred-appkit/tarball/main#subdirectory=packages/appkit",
    "@laughingwhales/appkit-adapter-wagmi": "https://api.github.com/repos/laughingwhales/sacred-appkit/tarball/main#subdirectory=packages/adapters/wagmi"
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Specific Version (Tag)

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@laughingwhales/appkit": "https://api.github.com/repos/laughingwhales/sacred-appkit/tarball/v1.8.21#subdirectory=packages/appkit"
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Feature Branch

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@laughingwhales/appkit": "https://api.github.com/repos/laughingwhales/sacred-appkit/tarball/feature/my-feature#subdirectory=packages/appkit"
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
# Work with local packages (default)
pnpm install
pnpm watch  # or pnpm build

# Changes are instantly reflected in apps/examples via workspace:*
```

### Deploying with GitHub Tarballs

```bash
# 1. Push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature"
git push origin main

# 2. Convert dependencies to GitHub URLs
pnpm deps:github main

# 3. Install and deploy
pnpm install
pnpm build
cd apps/demo && pnpm build
# ... deploy ...

# 4. Restore for local development
pnpm deps:workspace
pnpm install
```

## Why GitHub Tarballs?

We chose to support GitHub tarball URLs because:

‚úÖ **No npm publishing needed** - Push to GitHub and deploy immediately
‚úÖ **Test any branch** - Point to feature branches for testing
‚úÖ **Version pinning** - Use tags or commits for stability
‚úÖ **Fast iteration** - No waiting for npm registry propagation
‚úÖ **Monorepo friendly** - Subdirectory support for our packages

See [DEPENDENCY_STRATEGIES.md](DEPENDENCY_STRATEGIES.md) for a complete comparison.

## CI/CD Integration

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Convert to GitHub tarballs
  run: pnpm deps:github ${{ github.ref_name }}

- name: Install and build
  run: |
    pnpm install
    pnpm build

- name: Restore workspace
  run: pnpm deps:workspace
```

See [.github/workflows/deploy-with-tarballs.example.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-with-tarballs.example.yml) for complete example.

## Contributing

### Setting Up for Development

1. Fork and clone
2. Install: `pnpm install`
3. Build: `pnpm build`
4. Make changes
5. Test: `pnpm test`
6. Submit PR

### Publishing Changes

We use GitHub tarballs for most deployments, but for npm releases:

```bash
# 1. Version bump
pnpm changeset
pnpm changeset:version

# 2. Publish to npm
pnpm publish:latest

# 3. Tag release
git tag v1.9.0
git push --tags
```

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Tarball Issues

**Slow installs?**

- First install downloads from GitHub; subsequent installs are cached
- Consider pinning to commit SHAs for better caching

**Changes not showing?**

- Make sure you've pushed to GitHub
- Clear cache: `pnpm store prune`
- Delete node_modules and reinstall

**Private repo access?**

- Create GitHub personal access token
- Add to `.npmrc`: `//api.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN`
